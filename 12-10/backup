Sounds silly, right? Well, the fact is, the majority of businesses neglect their phone and are letting revenue and customers slip out of their hands!

Or what about Patients, Clients and existing Customers that need to reach their Physicians, Attorneys and other “must-speak-with” contacts? These are vital phone calls that require immediate attention. No business wants the reputation of not answering their phone and the credibility loss that comes with what would appear to be a lack of caring about their customers?
