OUTBOUND

TG Marketing’s growth can be attributed, almost exclusively, its outbound telemarketing services. We started as a B2B outbound call center specializing in appointment setting and lead generation and all proactive outbound telemarketing projects in the business-to-business realm. Over the years, we have executed highly successful outbound campaigns for thousands of unique Clients throughout both of our locations in Boise, ID and Salida, CA.

Each campaign is hand crafted by our Management team who has a collective 50+ years of industry experience. The campaigns we tailor for our Clients deliver high quality results that keep our Clients’ sales forces busy and drive sizeable returns on their investments with TGM.

Along with effective, results-oriented outbound call initiatives, TG Marketing is changing the industry reputation and becoming the “Good Guys” of the outbound industry. We don’t believe in long-term agreements until our Clients request them because they’ve seen our services work for them firsthand. We don’t think that business relationships should benefit one party more heavily than the other and that the best way to build a partnership with a marketing firm is through accountability and transparency. We are extremely confident in our ability to service our Clients on a personable level and through the results of our services that we DO NOT ever ask for our Clients to pay for ALL of their services in advance to begin our relationship, everything is billed on a per-week basis.

It’s a simple principle we firmly believe in- if we don’t execute or deliver what you expect, we know we can lose our Clients as fast as we earned them! And it’s poor business practice to continue to hold a Client captive because a contract is in place if the marketing efforts just aren’t working. This is a major contributing factor to why TGM has maintained an A+ rating with the BBB for 85% of it’s time in business.

Regardless if you’re a large, enterprise company looking to do thousands of hours of telemarketing or an independent representative that needs a few appointments per week to keep your sales pipeline flowing, we will accommodate your needs and budget while meeting expectations.
 
Outbound Services:
1.Appointment Setting:

Sales opportunities are known by different names to everyone. Some call a sales opportunity a “lead”, some call them “appointments” and oftentimes, the terms are so comingled that most don’t understand the difference. TGM bases their definitions of “appointment” and “lead” by the quality of the sales opportunity the Client is looking for.

To us, a direct, one on one sales opportunity with a verified decision maker in an organization is an appointment. These high-quality opportunities are as close to a sale that a Salesperson could ask for.

Appointment setting is our signature outbound service. We will work with you hand-in-hand to understand your business and your target demographics. It is our job to identify, target and qualify Decision Makers in those organizations you want to meet with and inform them about your services and offerings and how you benefit their business before we schedule them to meet with you through your preferred vehicle- face-to-face, telephone or online webinar/Skype.

All appointments set by your Business Development Representatives go through a rigorous Quality Control screening to ensure that all the qualifications are met, that the prospect is the true decision maker and to ensure that all the data we report to you for the meeting is accurate. We look to provide our Clients with the perfect combination of quality and quantity to ensure their partnership with TG Marketing is a long-lasting and successful relationship.
 
2.Lead Generation:

Lead Generation varies from Appointment Setting as it provides sales teams voluminous opportunities based on screening and qualifying prospects before the lead is handed off to the sales team. The objective of a lead generation campaign varies from Client to Client and the level of thoroughness we employ when qualifying and generating a lead is based on each Client’s individual needs. But the basic gist is still the same- to identify the decision maker, ask them qualifying questions to match them to your ideal prospect profile and once the lead is drilled down and qualified, they are handed off to the Client’s Salesforce.

You will receive the valuable information you need, including verified decision maker names, verified mailing and email addresses, direct phone numbers and other contact information as well as any other specific information that is vital to qualifying your prospects. Don’t have your sales force wasting time screening companies; utilize their time building relationships with qualified prospect. Let us do handle it so your team is doing what they do best- closing sales!
 
3.Database Cleansing and Verification:

All successful B2B marketing campaigns have one thing in common- an accurate marketing list. Like they say, “the money is in the list!”. If your data is dated, inaccurate or farmed from a “cheap” source, you are doing yourself a disservice and cutting the legs from under your marketing campaign before it has even begun!

People change jobs, companies go out of business or move locations and people are promoted into the decision-making positions you market to. Basically, if you haven’t updated your marketing list within the last year, it’s not accurate and you should expect a much lower response rate a much lower return on your investment. This is not a smart business practice!

Our trained Business Development Representatives will use their skills to extract the necessary data to fill-in the missing gaps and update all the invalid and expired data on your marketing list. The end result is an accurate, valuable marketing tool that will increase response rates and make your marketing efforts considerably more profitable.

We will return your database in a format that can be uploaded to all CRMs to ensure a seamless data transfer from us to you. Stop throwing your money away and give your marketing efforts the most room for success!
 
4.Market Research and Surveys:

One of the strongest tools to help gain a competitive advantage is through market research. Nobody has a true pulse on their market at every moment- there are always new trends and new competitors coming to market and these changes are constant and never ending.

So why start a marketing campaign in the blind? The best way for your company to meet the changing demands of the business world is to know your target audience’s preferences, buying habits and to get a good handle on the overall business climate in your immediate marketplace.

The only way you will know is by asking. Our Account Managers will work with you to build a robust market research campaign powered by a custom survey with questions that speak to your prospects and evoke the responses you need that will give you a firm grasp on the happenings and changes in your market. These responses in turn will become valuable data that will help you sharpen your message to your potential customers because it will be reflect the general consensus you discovered from the results of your market research.

Surveying is an excellent tool for companies in need of immediate, quantifiable data from their current and potential customer base. Companies that would like to know what their Customers are thinking utilize Customer Satisfaction surveys. Thoughtful employers that are looking for their employee’s feedback often have us conduct their surveys for them, as do political parties looking to reach out to their constituents, consumer watchdog groups looking to publish a review on particular products and Non-Profit organizations love to find out where there best donor concentrations are located through current event and lifestyles surveys.

If you don’t have the time or the manpower to ask, let us do the asking for you.
 
Event Attendance Registration and RSVP Services

Another way companies market is via live events- workshops, trade shows, seminars, mixers- to help reach their audience on a personal and intimate level. We can help you increase your attendance numbers and show-rate with a telemarketing campaign. We can take your Invitee list and inform them of the event and register them for it and, as the date of the event draws closer, we will give them a final RSVP call to remind them and to provide you with the most accurate list of verified attendees.

But what happens if you aren’t able to capture the contact info and feedback of your attendees at the event?

The best thing to do is have a follow up call campaign immediately after the event. The campaign can be geared as an appointment setting campaign, lead generation campaign or even a friendly survey so you can improve and expand on your next event. This is a great vehicle for Financial Services experts, Continuing Education groups, trade show vendors and Chambers of Commerce.
Customer Retention

A seasoned business owner, CEO and CFO will tell you the hardest part of business isn’t necessarily gaining new customers, it’s maintaining and keeping the existing customer base.

We can help maintain your customer base, as well as increase it, with our Customer Retention services. These services will also help you regain old customers and members. This is a favorite way for University Alumni booster foundations, Chambers of Commerce and any business that wants to retain a higher percentage of their customers and even win some old business back through Customer Satisfaction surveys or an exclusive offer or promotion that is warm and inviting to help you bring that customer back into your book of business.
Direct Marketing Follow Up

Direct-mail marketing comes in two main formats; traditional mail and email blast campaigns. But, the truth of the matter is there is no correct way or perfect marketing method. Most marketing efforts are maximized when supplemented by another marketing avenue that compliments the first vehicle and telemarketing is the perfect complement to both physical and electronic mail campaigns.

Some feel that mailing campaigns and email campaigns don’t provide a strong enough response to be utilized more. That is understandable and there are a lot of variables to consider. For traditional mail, you have to hope your piece makes it out of the mail room and onto the proper decision maker’s desk and then hope that your mailer is reviewed by that particular decision maker. Email campaigns face the same scenarios with Spam guards and email security at all-time highs.

Marketing should be a measurable and calculated undertaking and it seems that certain forms of direct marketing have high risk factors that return low response rates of 1% to 3%. But does that mean you should abort those forms of marketing? No not at all. Contact us and let’s get your response rates higher than you imagined possible![/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row centered="yes" bg_type="bg_color" bg_color_value="#00c5dc" css=".vc_custom_1503104029256{background-color: #0c8ec3 !important;}"][vc_column width="2/12"][/vc_column][vc_column width="8/12"][beeseo_quote_banner_tag quote_text="We promise you've never heard anything like this.
